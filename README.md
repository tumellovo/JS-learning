# Week 4 – JS Learning

Welcome to **Week 4** of my 9‑week coding journey — the moment JavaScript took centre stage!  
HTML gave us structure, CSS gave us style, and now JavaScript brings the brains.

## What’s Inside?

- `index.html` - Landing page that links to each mini project
- `calculator.html` - The main JavaScript calculator project
- `loginForm.html` - A basic login form with password validation
- `switch.html` - A weather advice demo using the `switch` statement
- `functions.html` - Function declarations and practice
- `stringsAndNumbers.html` - Playing with string and number methods
- `variableScope.html` - Understanding scope: `var`, `let`, `const`
- `password.html` - Simple password-checking demo
- `style.css` - Used only for the calculator

## Key Projects & Features

### 1. Calculator
Original buttons: `0‑9`, `AC`, `+ − × ÷`, `=`  
**Extras I added:**
- Memory buttons: `MC`, `MR`, `M−`, `M+`
- `%`, `√`, `±`, decimal point
- An **ON/OFF** switch

> **Quick access:** In `index.html` there’s a **bold “Open Calculator” link** so any visitor can jump straight to it.

### 2. Login Form
- User enters credentials → click **Log in**
- Correct creds ➜ “Correct. Logging you in…”
- Wrong creds ➜ “Username or password are incorrect.”

### 3. Weather Advice (switch demo)
- Dropdown forecasts: sunny, windy, rainy, snowy, cloudy  
- Click **GO!** ➜ shows tailored advice below using a `switch` statement.

## JavaScript Concepts Covered

- **Variables & Scope** (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- **Functions** (parameters, returns)
- **Strings & Numbers** (concatenation, parsing, maths)
- **`switch` Statements** for tidy multi‑branch logic
- **Basic DOM manipulation** (getting elements, updating text, showing/hiding sections)
- **Semicolons & syntax** — tiny characters, huge impact
- **Commenting** with `//` and `/* … */` to keep code clear
- A nod to **camelCase** naming (e.g. `stringsAndNumbers`) for readability

---

## Aha! Moments

- Forget to “call” a function? Nothing happens — JS obeys only what you invoke.
- Leave off a semicolon at the wrong spot? Errors pop faster than popcorn.
- Realising that *parameters* (the stuff inside brackets) are the data you hand to a function.
- Seeing how neat comments and camelCase keep larger scripts human‑friendly.

---

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Click the highlighted **Open Calculator** link (or any page link) to explore each mini‑project.  
3. No build tools needed — just pure HTML, CSS, and JS.
